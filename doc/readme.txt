Thank you for your interest in the Clear Demon Framework!

The CDF is a personal project that spawned out of necessity due to working on several PHP projects, but I was not
attracted to the overly complicated nature and requirements of other frameworks, such as Zend or Symphony.  Those
tools are great, but can be a little over the top [personal opinion].

CDF's main goals are to provide a simple and lightweight framework that does all the core things you'd expect, like
database access and abstraction, data object encapsulation and management, "safe" utility functions for data and
variable use, and also handy utility for either web or console-based applications. It is primarily low to mid-level
in its definition, so high-level functionality like PDF generation or user interface handling is not present.

Documentation for this is provided at class level in the framework directory using PHPDoc syntax. There is also
reference documentation that can be read on the CodePlex wiki: http://cdf.codeplex.com

Suggestions, critisim and submissions are welcome! Nothing is perfect. To provide feedback, please use the CodePlex
